This is a MVP app that allows you to check the likelihood of experiencing the side-effects for your medication regimen. It is targeted for patients who are taking 7+ medications and whose regimen may have competiting and compounding side effects. 

Typically side effects are presented for each drug you've been prescribed, but this app is unique because it displays your holistic side effects, based on your whole regimen. So, if you take 3 pills that have the same side-effect, your chances of experiencing that side-effect increase. 

Furthermore, side effects are usually presented as a long list of potential ailments, lacking the weighting to understand liklihood of experiencing. We calculate the percent likelihood a side-effect will occur based on the probability of independent variables (different medications). This is based on patient reported data from the members of patientslikeme.com.

To the run the app, download the folder. Then in terminal, run "node run.js". Then simply open index.html to begin using our app.
